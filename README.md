# Chinese Porcelain Slideshow
This class project was to build on our skill on CSS media queries, applying one and two column layout where it changes at a certain breakpoint.
I also applied a bit of advaced CSS, such as viewport width, viewport height, including em and rem. This makes the words responsive as well as the images.
